Deployment and Engineering steps:
1. Run the baseline and final model on local computer
2. Load the model and its features to a pickle file
3. Use Flask to deploy the model as API
4. The api should take feature values as input and return the predicted revenue value
5. Both input and output are in json format and end users can change and manipulate them accordingly
6. Test the API on Postman and deploy the API as a script on an EC2 server on AWS
